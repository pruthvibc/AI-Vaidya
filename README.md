## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

1. **Data Processing:**  
   - Text cleaning, chunking, and formatting.  
   - Convert text into embeddings (semantic vectors).

2. **Model Usage:**  
   - Language model processes user queries.  
   - Vector search retrieves relevant text chunks.  
   - AI generates answers based on retrieved content.

3. **User Flow:**  
   1. User asks a question in English.  
   2. Query is converted to embedding.  
   3. System searches vector database for relevant content.  
   4. AI generates and displays the answer.
